        <h2>Margin</h2>
        <p>Margin is the space outside an element's border, creating distance between the element and surrounding elements. It does not affect the element's size but pushes it away from other content on the page. Margins can be set
             individually for each side (top, right, bottom, left) or applied uniformly using a single value.</p>
